# AASTU-Clinic-Project
This c++ program utilizes structures and function to address the challanges of using tradational recording method in the clinic. By leveraging the 
knowledge of C++ structures, the project provides a structured approach to
store and manipulate patient information, including name, age, contact details, and medical
history. The use of structures allows for the creation of well-defined data entities, facilitating
easy access and manipulation of patient records within the system.
The system also incorporates C++ file handling mechanisms to ensure persistent storage of
data. Patient records, appointment details, and medical staff information are saved in separate
files. The file inclusion concept in C++ enables the system to read data from files during startup
and write data to files when changes occur, ensuring data integrity and providing a reliable
means of data storage.
The University Clinic Management System project demonstrates the capability to design and
implement a functional clinic management system using the knowledge of C++ structures and
file inclusion. By adhering to the structure concept, the project achieves a modular and
organized codebase, facilitating future enhancements or additions to the system.
It's important to note that while this project focuses on the knowledge up to the C++ structure
concept and file inclusion, it can serve as a foundation for further development. As the project
evolves, additional functionalities or advanced features can be incorporated by leveraging
higher-level C++ concepts or external libraries while maintaining the core structure-based
implementation.
